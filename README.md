# ðŸ“˜ Machine Learning Training & Projects

This repository contains my code, notes, and projects as I work through a structured **Machine Learning Training Plan**.  
It covers foundations, core ML techniques, and culminates in building a full project: **Chinese Character Converter**.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

- **Phase 1: Foundations (7/09 â€“ 7/27)**  
  Introductory ML concepts with Googleâ€™s [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course).  
  Covered basics of regression, classification, neural networks, embeddings, production ML systems, and problem framing.

- **Phase 2: Core ML Techniques (7/25 â€“ 10/02)**  
  Deep dive into *Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn* by Sebastian Raschka.  
  Covering supervised, unsupervised, neural networks, transformers, GANs, GNNs, and reinforcement learning.

- **Final Project (10/13 â€“ 11/16)**  
  Build and deploy a Chinese Character Converter web app:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - ML model development
  - Backend service
  - Frontend UI
  - Deployment & publishing
